# Covid 19 Cases Suspected In All Regions of Pakistan
This project was for general public awarness and a small contribution from Aisol for the safety of people during pandemic days.
The data was not extracted from any specific source rather online search and kaggle.
Tableau software is used for data visualization as it provides great visuals. By these visuals we examined the growth of Covid-19 in Pakistan.
Based on the data of millions of population in each region, making it easier for common man to visualize at a glance.
The outcome of this research and report would be: 

1. A clear picture of covid-19 cases in regions of Pakistan 
2. It will be easier to provide necessary aid as per need to that specific region
3. Emergency lock down in specific region
4. People will be restricted to visit that area to avoid vast spread of pandemic
5. It will be helpful for healthcare sector and medical institutes to have an easy and quick picture of the report based on millions of people's data
